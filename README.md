ðŸ“Œ A/B Testing Vodafone CTA: "Read More" vs. "Find Your SIM-Only Plan"

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This project conducts an A/B test to evaluate whether changing Vodafone's call-to-action (CTA) button text from "Read More" to "Find Your SIM-Only Plan" leads to a statistically and practically significant improvement in the Click-Through Rate (CTR). The goal was to achieve at least a 10% increase in CTR, ultimately driving higher revenue through improved user engagement.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Methodology
Python: Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for data processing and analysis.
Z-Test: Applied for statistical significance at a 5% significance level (Î± = 0.05) to determine if the observed CTR increase is likely driven by the CTA change, not random fluctuations.
95% Confidence Interval (CI): To estimate the true range of CTR improvement, ensuring that the results are both statistically valid and practically meaningful.

Visualizations: Seaborn & Matplotlib were used to present the results, including rejection regions and standard normal distributions, making the statistical evidence clear.
ðŸ“Š Results & Interpretation
The null hypothesis (Hâ‚€) was strongly rejected at Î± = 0.05, indicating that the observed CTR increase is highly unlikely to be attributed to random chance.

Key insights include:

A narrow confidence interval around the CTR improvement estimate indicates high precision and reliability in the results.
The sample showed a great representation of the population, ensuring the results are robust and generalizable.
The new CTA, "Find Your SIM-Only Plan," achieved a statistically significant increase in CTR, with the 95% confidence interval confirming that the improvement is both real and meaningful.
With a Minimal Detectable Effect (MDE) of 0.1, the difference between the control and experimental groups was not only statistically significant but also practically impactful, indicating that the CTR boost will translate into tangible outcomes, such as increased sales and higher revenue.

ðŸš€ Business Implications
Vodafone should be motivated to implement the new CTA "Find Your SIM-Only Plan" across its platform, as the results show clear, measurable benefits. This change isnâ€™t just statistically significant; it is practically significant, meaning it will lead to higher CTR, greater user engagement, and ultimately, higher revenue.

By adopting this CTA, Vodafone can expect a boost in conversions, driving more customers to take the next steps, such as signing up for SIM-only plans. This increase in user interaction will likely have a direct, positive impact on revenue generation.

This study demonstrates the power of A/B testing in refining user experiences, optimizing business outcomes, and making data-driven decisions that contribute to long-term growth and increased profitability.
