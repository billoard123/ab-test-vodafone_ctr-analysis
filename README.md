ðŸ“Œ A/B Testing Vodafone CTA: "Read More" vs. "Find Your SIM-Only Plan"
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
This project performs an A/B test to determine whether changing Vodafoneâ€™s CTA button text from "Read More" to "Find Your SIM-Only Plan" statistically and practically significantly improves the Click-Through Rate (CTR). The goal was to achieve a 10% increase in CTR.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Methodology
Python: Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for data processing
Z-Test for Statistical Significance at a 5% significance level (Î± = 0.05) to assess whether the observed CTR increase is likely due to the CTA change rather than random chance.
95% Confidence Interval (CI) Calculation to estimate the true range of CTR improvement.
Visualizations: Seaborn & Matplotlib to illustrate the statistical results, including rejection regions and standard normal distributions.
ðŸ“Š Results & Interpretation
The null hypothesis (Hâ‚€) was strongly rejected at Î± = 0.05, indicating that the observed CTR increase is highly unlikely to be due to chance.
A 95% confidence interval confirmed that the true CTR improvement is within a meaningful range.
The new CTA, "Find Your SIM-Only Plan," successfully achieved the target 10% increase in CTR, making the change both statistically and practically significant.
ðŸš€ Business Implications
These results provide strong evidence that Vodafone should implement the new CTA across its platform. It has been shown to significantly improve user engagement and potential conversions. This study demonstrates the value of A/B testing in optimizing user interactions and improving key business metrics.
